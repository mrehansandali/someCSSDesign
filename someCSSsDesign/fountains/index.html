                <h1>How SEO Works!</h1>
                <p>Search engines use bots to crawl on web pages. As they go from site to site collecting information on those pages, they are put into an index. There are algorithms that analyze and take into account different ranking signals or factors that determine the order of pages in the search result when a user enters a search query.
                    These rankings are organic and unlike paid search ads. Therefore, you cannot pay to get yourself at the top of the Google results page. Therefore, you have to put in real work to see that your page is even on the first page. While it is possible to achieve a first-page ranking on your own, the process is not a walk in the park if SEO is not your specialization.
                    This is where we come in.
